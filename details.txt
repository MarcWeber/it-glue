TODO: make this nicer

I have been programming for over 20 years, and it always takes a lot of time to
assess or try out if software projects are easy to install. Manual README
instructions are nice, but they don't compete with app stores.

Installing, trying out, and deleting should also be easy for complex
environments, but it isn't because there are many different operating systems,
programming languages, and settings. At the same time, the world only changes
slowly because new technologies don't yet have all the functions. So, there is
always the desire to combine old and new techniques. This issue also arises
with all programs that allow scripting languages. (Neo)Vim, Blender, Gimp,
Krita are just a few well-known examples.

IT Glue aims to redesign the relationships between projects and package
databases flexibly so that installing, developing, and distributing packages is
simple.

Details:
IT-glue replaces Github's README.md instructions with a script so that
developers and users can easily compile, run, and update software. Native
package managers of the platform will be used where appropriate.

Developers are provided with further actions such as integrating into existing
distribution paths and abstractions to save time. Additionally, collections [0]
of software can be managed together so that mutual dependencies are managed by
dev-glue up to the distribution.

Similar to nixpkgs, there should be different ways to hash build results. For
example, 'always current,' by 'binary compatibility,' or 'source
compatibility.' Naturally, nixpkgs will also be seen as a native package
manager and can be used alongside conda, brew, and others as a distribution
path. This makes it possible to try out multiple platforms and toolchains
simultaneously by separating source and build directories.

The graph that maps the package dependencies can be used to 'update everything'
or 'compile' everything. Like a "Ninja," but on a package level, which calls
the package-specific build systems.

By snapshotting known repositories like PyPi, it should be possible to achieve
deterministic results as far as possible even without lock files. In words: Try
to provide an environment as it would have been created at the time the author
made their commit.

It is so complicated because there are many operating systems [1], programming
languages [2], language-specific [3] or distribution-specific [4] package
managers, external libraries [6], distribution paths [7], and toolchains [8].

Therefore, we need a tool that achieves the following goals:

1) Can describe cross-language platform dependencies. Example: "Need OpenGL/Vulkan"

2) Resolves Microservice vs. Monorepo.
   A, B, C depend on each other, have the same version 2.0, and therefore create package.json automatically.

3) Manage your own local package libraries:
   Because the Github author didn't do it, check out X and assume it's version 2.0 with patch P.

4) Provides scripts to, for example, recompile Firefox with Libjpeg or package for Chocolately/Conda.

5) Reproducibility on different levels:
   - Build path
   - ABI compatibility
   - Exact version and dependencies nixpkgs

6) If possible, optionally specify an evaluation time when it comes to
   resolving dependencies from known package databases like PyPi, Hackage, because
   there are not always version lock files.

  Example tasks in words that the system should be able to solve:

   With packages from Ubuntu
   With package list [github:user/repo-1, github:user/repo-2]
   Find dependencies of repo-2, install Ubuntu packages
   Provide build-all script.

[0] Collections simply mean I have 30 small JavaScript/TypeScript repositories
    and 10 websites or apps that need to work together and be maintained. So, for
    example, they also get a common version. By defining the collection, mutual
    dependencies are automatically recognized and 'package.json' files are created.
    At the same time, common configurations for editors etc. can be provided. For
    example, eslint.json configuration files.

2) What social problem do you want to solve with your project?
   Explain clearly what problem you want to address and relate the project idea to it.

   I want to enable software programmers to create a description so that their
   software can be reproduced and installed with minimal effort, so typical
   README.md files on Github shrink to:

   If the user is a developer, they have the option to control whose dependency
   code they can edit and recompile via script. For example, prepare a
   development environment by allowing me to edit Libjpeg and Firefox code with
   a "compile everything and then start" script.

3) How do you want to implement it technically?
   Show that the applicants have already thought about the implementation of
   the idea – the idea is not a quick shot. This does not mean that the project
   must ultimately be implemented exactly as described.

   The past has shown that declarative systems are good, but in the end,
   programming elements were always added, like in Ansible.

   Therefore, I want to use a programming language like TS/Rust from the start
   to create a modular flexible system that adapts to the task.

   Here is a more complex example that shows how libraries are cloned from
   Github, then included in a temporary own package list, and resolved for
   dependencies. For each package, it can be specified whether it is to be
   built with cmake, scons. At the same time, the strength of a programming
   language is evident because you can define git_mit_themen_zweig once, which
   is more efficient than a declarative approach.

   In the end, scripts are defined that compile the target over several
   libraries and for 2 Godot versions.

   The flexibility is evident because the result is a list of actions. This can
   be expanded at will.

    story_name   = "godotvnc-update"

    git_mit_themen_zweig = (repo) => git({repo, upload_to: my_bare_location, story-branch-name: story_name })
    openssl      = git_with_topic_branch('x/libopenssl')
    libjpeg      = git_with_topic_branch('x/libjpeg')
    libpng       = git_with_topic_branch('x/libpng')

    godot_cpp_headers_4  = git:('x/godot_cpp_headers_4', upload_to: my_bare_location, master as story_name)
    godot_cpp_headers_3  = git:('x/godot_cpp_headers_3', upload_to: my_bare_location, master as story_name)

    godot_vnc_master = git_from_my_repo('xx', {initialize_from: 'github:a/b'})
    hack_on_godot_3_vnc = godot_vnc_master.worktree_branch('fix_godot_3_vnc')
    hack_on_godot_4_vnc = godot_vnc_master.worktree_branch('fix_godot_4_vnc')

    packages = [
      autoconf(openssl, ...),
      cmake(libjpeg, ...),
      cmake(libpng, ...),
      nixpkgs("scons")
    ]

    env_hack_on_godot_3 = solve(...)

    env_hack_on_godot_4 = solve(...)

    actions = {
      "info": info about paths etc?
      build_all = build_all(env_hack_on_godot_3, env_hack_on_godot_4)
    }

4) What similar solutions already exist and what will your project do differently or better?

   Gentoo: Uses shell scripts but only supports its own Linux.
   scons/mamba. They have .yaml files. Configuration files are too complicated
   if you want to test entire dependency chains with different toolchains.

   Nixpkgs: Linux/Darwin only. Perfect distribution, but not helpful for the developer.

   Github Build hooks. These do not unify dependencies.

   Arduino IDE: No comparison.

   Maven/pip/...(20x) -> Only Java/Python/...

5) Reproducibility on different levels:
   - Build path
   - ABI compatibility
   - Exact version and dependencies nixpkgs

6) If possible, optionally specify an evaluation time when it comes to
    resolving dependencies from known package databases like PyPi, Hackage, because
    there are not always version lock files.

    openssl      = git_mit_themen_zweig('x/libopenssl')

      "info": info about paths etc?
      build_all = build_all(env_hack_on_godot_3, env_hack_on_godot_4)
    }


4) What similar solutions already exist and what will your project do differently or better?

  Nixos.org/Nixpkgs: Nur Linux/Drawin aber nicht abstrakt genug
  Ansible/Chef/..: Nicht abstrakt genug, weil sie keine Solver eingebaut haben
  Chocolately && : nur Binary distribution
  Conda/Xmake etc -> fokussiert auf Dist-Pakete, aber die Abstraktion diese
                Dist-Pakete zu erstellen ist was IT-Glue ausmachen wird.

   Gentoo: shell scripts ?

   scons/mamba: .yaml files. If you want to express complicated dependencies
    with options (what C compiler) and dependencies seems too complicated

   Nixpkgs: Linux/Darwin only. Perfect distribution, but only partially for
    devs if you want to hack on 3 dependencies at the same time!

   Github Build hooks. Loosely related but you cannot hack and rebuild easily

   Arduino IDE: .. 

   Maven/pip/...(20x) -> Nur Java/Python/...

5) Who is the target audience and how will your tool reach them?
   Show that the project ideas potentially have a broad societal reach and that
   the applicants understand what will be particularly important in developing
   their software. The measures to reach the target audience show that the
   applicants have thought about the spread and use of the software.

   I have exactly three target groups:

   1) Users who want to install software or collections.
   2) Users who want to try out software.
   3) Developers who want to program with it.

   Users who want to install software or collections:
   You search for an application and get a list of systems or dependencies that
   are needed. You have the option to modify parameters if the developer has
   defined these.

   Users who want to try out software:
   You check the description and install software with one command.

   Developers who want to program with it:
   It is determined what system they have and what is needed. Optionally: Which compiler etc.
   Then a development environment is created.



Rough estimation of effort:

  Hard to judge. Assuming 2 days for each item. Listing items ..

  Components to be integrated:

  9 + 9 + 6 + 24 + 6 + 2 + 12 + 6 + 8 + 7 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 104

  So will take at least 204 days
